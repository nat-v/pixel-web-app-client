# pixel-web-app-client
Pixel art web app (client part) built with React/Redux

Originally it was a university project that I was working on from March till June 2020. It didn't turned out exactly how I wanted and there is still lots of work to do to improve and finalise the project. 

This repository is dedicated to:
* clean up/rewrite/update the project and make it work;
* improve my skills with React/Redux in a process;
* keep track of a progress. 

##

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
